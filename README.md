# ResNet1d

Implementation of ResNet1d architecture and Notebooks with results

Image classification is a long-standing and one of the most researched problems of computer vision and a field of modern neural networks. Image classification is often associated with the introduction to the world of deep learning techniques and the field of modern artificial intelligence. Modern image classification models have become so powerful in handling images with 3 channels. In this [paper](report/ResNet1d.pdf) ResNet1d was proposed as a method that uses principles of modern image classification approaches that are considered state-of-the-art.

Experiment results displayed and discussed are saved and portrayed in [notebooks](notebooks/)

Repository installation (yet to test the training script and workout requirements part):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a3a256/ResNet1d.git
```
